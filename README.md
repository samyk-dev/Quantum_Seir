# Quantum-Inspired SEIR Simulator for Networked and Chemical Systems

This project implements a **probabilistic node-network model** inspired by quantum principles to simulate **SEIR dynamics** and **chemical analogs**. Nodes exist in **superposition across compartments** (`S, E, I, R`), enabling efficient uncertainty quantification, stochastic variability, and realistic networked interactions. Originally developed as a midterm project, the model was refined and expanded into a full application with interactive simulation and analysis features.

## Background

The classical **SEIR model** is a [compartmental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_%28epidemiology%29) in epidemiology, dividing populations into:

* S ‚Äì Susceptible
* E ‚Äì Exposed (infected but not yet infectious)
* I ‚Äì Infected (actively transmitting)
* R ‚Äì Recovered/Removed

Transitions follow S ‚Üí E ‚Üí I ‚Üí R with rates Œ≤ (infection), œÉ (incubation), and Œ≥ (recovery).

This project extends SEIR modeling by representing each node as a **probability vector** `[S, E, I, R]`, capturing uncertainty directly at the node level. Nodes interact via **network structures**, where the **infection pressure** governs transitions from S ‚Üí E:

* In **networked mode**, a node‚Äôs infection probability is proportional to the mean infected fraction among its neighbors.
* In **global mode**, infection pressure is the mean infected fraction across all nodes.

This mechanism allows local structure or coupling to influence transmission dynamically. Interventions such as lockdowns (reducing Œ≤), vaccinations (shifting nodes to R), or chemical process modifications are applied directly to probabilities at each step.

## Reaction Kinetics Analogy

The same probabilistic SEIR framework maps naturally to chemical reaction networks:

| Epidemiology          | Chemistry             |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| S ‚Äì Susceptible       | Reactant (A)          |
| E ‚Äì Exposed           | Intermediate (B)      |
| I ‚Äì Infected          | Product (C)           |
| R ‚Äì Recovered/Removed | Removed/Byproduct (D) |

Transition rates correspond to chemical kinetics:

* Œ≤ ‚Üí reaction or mixing rate
* œÉ ‚Üí conversion from intermediate to product
* Œ≥ ‚Üí removal, degradation, or byproduct formation

Infection pressure in epidemiology is analogous to **reaction pressure**: the rate at which a reactant converts to product depends on neighboring concentrations (or catalytic influence). Networked interactions represent coupled reactors, spatially distributed zones, or catalytic surfaces, whereas global interactions simulate perfectly mixed reactors. This enables **probabilistic reaction kinetics modeling** where node concentrations exist in superposition, capturing stochasticity and localized effects.

## Quantum-Inspired Approach

Nodes are represented as **probabilistic superstates** across `[S, E, I, R]` rather than discrete compartments. Combined with network-based infection/reaction pressure, this approach embeds uncertainty directly, reduces ensemble size requirements, and captures realistic local and global dynamics. The method is computationally efficient and applies to epidemics, chemical reaction networks, and other complex compartmental systems with heterogeneity.

## Why It Matters

This framework enables:

* **Realistic uncertainty modeling** at the node level
* **Network-aware dynamics** reflecting local connectivity
* **Interactive exploration** of interventions and parameter changes
* **Decision support** using infection/reaction pressure and uncertainty bands
* **Dual applicability**: epidemiology, chemical engineering, industrial systems

---

## How It Works

1. Initialize nodes with `[S, E, I, R]` probabilities
2. Construct network of local or global interactions
3. Compute **infection/reaction pressure** for each node:
   * Networked mode: mean infected/converted fraction among neighbors
   * Global mode: mean infected/converted fraction across all nodes
4. Update states using effective rates (Œ≤, œÉ, Œ≥) modified by interventions
5. Apply policies such as lockdowns, vaccinations, or chemical modifications
6. Run ensembles to generate **uncertainty bands**
7. Perform sensitivity analysis on key parameters
8. Visualize outputs with interactive plots
